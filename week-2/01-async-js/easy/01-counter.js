// Create a counter in javascript
// We have already covered this in the second lesson, but as an easy recap try to code a counter in Javascript
// It should go up as time goes by in intervals of 1 second

let counter = 0

setInterval(() => {
    counter++
    console.log(counter);
}, 1000); // 1000ms = 1sec


// prints the counter into console
// click crtl+c to exit
